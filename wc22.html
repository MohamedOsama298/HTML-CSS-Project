        <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 22nd edition of FIFA's competition for men's national football teams. The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the country's National Day, and was contested by Argentina and 2018 champions France. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, with two wins and one loss, before defeating Australia in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final and Croatia in the semi-final. France finished top of Group D with two wins and one loss, before defeating Poland in the round of 16, England in the quarter-final and Morocco in the semi-final. The final was refereed by Szymon Marciniak from Poland and took place in front of 88,966 spectators.

            Argentina led 2–0 at half-time through goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María, but Kylian Mbappé equalized for France by scoring two goals in two minutes after the 80th minute. During extra time, Messi scored an additional goal 10 minutes before Mbappé completed his hat-trick, leaving the match tied at 3–3. Argentina won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4–2 to earn their third World Cup, and first since 1986. Argentina became the second team after Spain in 2010 to win the World Cup after losing their opening game. France became the first team to score three goals in a World Cup final and lose. The final has been widely regarded as the greatest FIFA World Cup Final of all time, and one of the greatest matches in the history of the sport</p>
