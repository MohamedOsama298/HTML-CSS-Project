        <p>José Luis Brown opened the scoring for Argentina in the 23rd minute with a header after an error of the German Keeper Harald Schumacher on a free-kick from the right and it stayed at 1–0 until half-time. 11 minutes into the second half, Jorge Valdano doubled Argentina's lead with a low side foot finish after cutting in from the left past the advancing goalkeeper. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge pulled a goal back in the 74th minute from close range for West Germany, his first goal in the tournament. West Germany then equalised in the 81st minute, with Rudi Völler scoring with a header from close range. Although Diego Maradona was heavily marked by Lothar Matthäus throughout the game, his pass to Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute allowed Argentina to regain the lead at 3–2 when he slid the ball past the advancing goalkeeper from the right and into the corner of the net.[3][4]

            Six yellow cards were issued in this match, which was a record number until the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final. Two of them were issued because of timewasting from Argentine players. As the clock expired, Argentina celebrated their second World Cup victory in three tournaments after having won the 1978 World Cup on home soil.</p>
